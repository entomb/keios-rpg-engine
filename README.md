#Keios
Keios is an attempt to recreate old fashioned text based browser based RPG's 

As every developer is more interested in hacking high performance JS games, old text combat based RPGs are hard to find.
Keios is in its most early stages of development is _not open_ for fork/pull


###The Engine
The main focus will be an open skill based engine that would fit different scenarios, so different game rule-sets/themes can be applied on top of it.

The focus right now to find an elegant skill/stat system without approaching the boring (but perfect) d20. if this fails, d20 shall be used for the sake of balance.

###The Game
Is obviously under construction... and already you just lost it
